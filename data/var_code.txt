subject -- subject ID 
rsi -- response-stimulus interval, how long points were visible before stimulus onset
block -- position in the experiment (out of 12)
block_c -- same as above except the distribution is centered at block 6 (total number of blocks = 12)
blocktime -- amount of time it took to complete a given block
trial -- each row represents one trial
current -- factor var representing whether the value of the task performed on previous trial changed (1 = decrease by a point, 0 = remained constant)
other -- same as ^ except represents value changes for task not performed on previous trial and (1 = increase by a point, 0 = remain constant)
difference -- difference between values on present trial (other - current; pos values indicate difference in favor of other task)
stim.rep -- did the stimulus repeat from the previous trial
pvsum -- sum of points
rt -- amount of time between stimulus onset and response on present trial
transcode -- task selection at trial N relative to selection at trial N-1 (1 = switched to the opposite task, 0 = repeated same task)


the scatter plot i made required computing several between-subject variables
	i summarized all of that in the coding for the individual_difference var data
