# Assessing the role of reward in task selection using a reward-based voluntary task switching paradigm
## David Braun & Catherine M. Arrington

The purpose of this repository is to provide a brief and accessible synopsis of the main analyses reported in this publication. The ./markdown directory contains R Markdown documents for all phases of the major analyses, as well as background about the theory and methods. The original code used for the full analyses is located in the ./scripts directory. The R Markdown files were written after the paper had been published.
